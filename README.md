# Lucaspbastos Cask
My personal Tap for casks I use that aren't available on Homebrew's cask Tap.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install lucaspbastos/cask/<formula>`

Or `brew tap lucaspbastos/cask` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "lucaspbastos/cask"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
